Big Mart Sales Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach

1. Problem Statement
A brief description of the challenge: predicting Item_Outlet_Sales to identify key factors influencing retail sales. Mention that the evaluation metric is RMSE.

2. Approach
A high-level overview of your methodology.

Data Preparation: Briefly describe the data cleaning steps, including handling missing values, inconsistencies, and zero values.

Feature Engineering: Mention the new features you created, such as Outlet_Age and the breakdown of Item_Identifier.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarize the key findings from your visualizations, highlighting the most influential features (Item_MRP and Outlet_Type).

Modeling: Explain that you used an end-to-end machine learning pipeline with a logarithmic transformation of the target variable to handle skewness. Mention that a Bayesian optimization was performed using Optuna to find the best hyperparameters for your final XGBoost model.

3. Key Findings
Item_MRP is the single most important predictor of sales.

Outlet_Type (especially "Supermarket Type3") is a highly influential categorical feature.

The model discovered that Outlet_Age and Item_Visibility have significant predictive power, even though their linear correlation was weak.
